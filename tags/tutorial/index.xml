      <description>Precision, recall and the derived concepts are very important in Machine Learning (and more generally in statistics) yet can be hard to grasp. In this article I explain what they are, why they are useful and how to use them.
What&amp;rsquo;s the point ? First off, it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand why those concepts were introduced and why they are useful. I am going to use an example throughout this post to make things clearer.</description>

      <description>Having a personal website is very useful, for many reasons. However, building one is sometimes a bit difficult. Of course there&amp;rsquo;s WordPress, but it can feel a bit heavy, and too abstract for someone who likes to code. On the other hand, Web Development is not easy and can be time consuming.
Here I&amp;rsquo;ll describe how I went about making my personal website (this one) and how I deployed it on GitHub Pages.</description>
