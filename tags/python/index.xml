      <description>Python is a very beginner-friendly language. However, it also has some more advanced features that can be hard to grasp. For me at least, decorators were one of them. I was seeing them here and there but never fully understood what they did and how they worked, even after reading a bunch of stuff about them. Until I came across the talk &amp;lsquo;So you want to be a Python expert&amp;rsquo; by James Powell in which he explains four key features of Python, including decorators.</description>
