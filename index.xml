      <title>Setting Up a First Personal Website</title>

      <description>Here I&amp;rsquo;ll describe how I went about making my personal website (this one) and how I deployed it on github pages. The whole process wasn&amp;rsquo;t as easy as I thought it would be so hopefully this will help someone else down the line.
The assumptions I&amp;rsquo;ll make :  You are reasonnably familiar with the command line ; You are reasonnably familiar with Git and GitHub ; You are reasonnably familiar with the web languages : HTML and CSS.</description>

      <description>This is my roadmap to go from an undergraduate CS and math background to a very good understanding of Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts, and more importantly to successfully apply ML and DL. I will put here everything I&amp;rsquo;ve done, I&amp;rsquo;m doing, and I&amp;rsquo;m planning on doing in order to reach that goal. What I&amp;rsquo;ve already completed will be in italic, and what I&amp;rsquo;m currently doing in bold.

      <description>Hello there !
I&amp;rsquo;m a CS student that discovered Machine Learning in 2018. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working hard to learn it all since then. I&amp;rsquo;m especially interested in Deep Learning.
In addition to the courses I have at my university, I&amp;rsquo;m also a strong believer in self-learning. I&amp;rsquo;m often doing MOOCs and building things to learn. For example, I&amp;rsquo;ve attended version 3 of the fast.ai course live from October through December (that was a bit hard because the classes were beginning at 3 a.</description>
