      <title>Finally understanding decorators in Python</title>

      <description>Python is a very beginner-friendly language. However, it also has some more advanced features that can be hard to grasp. For me at least, decorators were one of them. I was seeing them here and there but never fully understood what they did and how they worked, even after reading a bunch of stuff about them. Until I came across the talk &amp;lsquo;So you want to be a Python expert&amp;rsquo; by James Powell in which he explains four key features of Python, including decorators.</description>

      <title>Understanding precision and recall</title>

      <description>Precision, recall and the derived concepts are very important in Machine Learning (and more generally in statistics) yet can be hard to grasp. In this article I explain what they are, why they are useful and how to use them.
What&amp;rsquo;s the point ? First off, it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand why those concepts were introduced and why they are useful. I am going to use an example throughout this post to make things clearer.</description>

      <title>Setting Up a First Personal Website</title>

      <description>Having a personal website is very useful, for many reasons. However, building one is sometimes a bit difficult. Of course there&amp;rsquo;s WordPress, but it can feel a bit heavy, and too abstract for someone who likes to code. On the other hand, Web Development is not easy and can be time consuming.
Here I&amp;rsquo;ll describe how I went about making my personal website (this one) and how I deployed it on GitHub Pages.</description>

      <title>Roadmap to ML</title>

      <description>This is my roadmap to go from an undergraduate CS and math background to a very good understanding of Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts, and more importantly to successfully apply ML and DL. I will put here everything I&amp;rsquo;ve done (in italic), I&amp;rsquo;m doing (in bold), and I&amp;rsquo;m planning on doing (normal text) in order to reach that goal.

      <description>Hello there !
I&amp;rsquo;m a CS student who discovered Machine Learning in 2018 and who has been working hard to learn it since then. I&amp;rsquo;m especially interested in Deep Learning.
I’m a strong believer in self-learning. So in addition to my French engineering school, I take MOOCs and build things to learn and practice. For example, I attended version 3 of the fast.ai course live from October to December — a rather tough planning for me because the classes were beginning at 3 am France time and my engineering class started at 8 am, but great course.</description>
