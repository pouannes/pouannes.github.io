      <title>Setting Up a First Personal Website</title>

      <description>Here I&amp;rsquo;ll describe how I went about making my personal website (this one) and how I deployed it on github pages. The whole process wasn&amp;rsquo;t as easy as I thought it would be so hopefully this will help someone else down the line.
The assumptions I&amp;rsquo;ll make :  You are reasonnably familiar with the command line ; You are reasonnably familiar with Git and GitHub ; You are reasonnably familiar with the web languages : HTML and CSS.</description>

      <title>Roadmap to ML</title>

      <description>This is my roadmap to go from an undergraduate CS and math background to a very good understanding of Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts, and more importantly to successfully apply ML and DL. I will put here everything I&amp;rsquo;ve done, I&amp;rsquo;m doing, and I&amp;rsquo;m planning on doing in order to reach that goal. What I&amp;rsquo;ve already completed will be in italic, what I&amp;rsquo;m currently doing in bold and the rest is what I&amp;rsquo;m planning on doing next.</description>

      <description>Hello there !
I&amp;rsquo;m a CS student who discovered Machine Learning in 2018. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working hard to learn it since then. I&amp;rsquo;m especially interested in Deep Learning.
I’m also a strong believer in self-learning. So in addition to my French engineering school, I take MOOCs and build things to learn and practice. For example, I’ve attended version 3 of the fast.ai course live from October to December - a rather tough planning for me because the classes were beginning at 3 a.</description>
